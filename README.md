## What this project is?

This project is a HTML5 about cooking recipes small website that offer to the users information about interesting recipes and instructions on how to prepare it. 
At this point of TOP curriculum, this project allow me demonstrate my skill about HTML5 and basic Git use, while I'll continue my learning journey in the world of web development along TOP.


## What I did?

Main structure of my *Odin Recipes Project* is comprised as follows:

HTML Documents:

- index.html: website's main page with navigation links to the recipes.
- Recipes's HTML documents that contain recipe's related info.

Folders:

- An img folder that stores the website's general images.
- A recipes folder that stores the recipes's pages.
- An images folder into the recipes directory that stores recipe related images.

***NOTE:*** At this point into the TOP's curriculum I didn't reached the CSS lessons **yet**.
