                <h2>Mantecol is a fabulous peanut-based sweet from Argentina</h2>
        <p>Mantecol was born in Argentina in the 1940s by the Georgalos candy company. It's one of the best and most popular candies in the 
        country. It's also a delicacy on the Christmas table. Celebrities can never miss it. It has a soft, firm, spongy, and crunchy texture.</p>

                <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>200 gr. of peanut butter</li>
                    <li>10 tablespoons sugar</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
                    <li>Syrup</li>

                <h3>Step by step:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Use a saucepan and pour the water, lemon juice, and sugar into it. Place it over low heat and mix until the syrup forms a ball. How do you do this?
                    Using a spoon, remove a little of the syrup and pour it into a glass of cold water. If you can form a ball with your fingers, it's ready.</li>
                    <li>Place the syrup in the mixer, add the peanut butter, and mix until the mixture is well combined and creamy (use a spoon to rearrange the mixture
                    and continue beating)</li>
                    <li>Place the mixture on a table. Our goal is to dissolve any remaining syrup. Break it into small pieces with your hands or a knife and then stir
                    it back togheter.</li>
                    <li>Once the paste is combined, transfer it to a nonstick mold or one lined with plastic wrap.</li>
                    <li>Flatten the mantecol with a spoon, as much as possible. Cover with plastic wrap and place a weight on top, then refrigerate for 24 hours.</li>
                    <li>After 24 hours, remove from the mold.</li>
                </ol>
