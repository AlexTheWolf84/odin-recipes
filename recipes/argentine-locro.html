        <h1>Argentine Locro</h1>
        <h2>A very popular meal in Argentina</h2>
        <p>This is a traditional dish in Argentina, especially during national holidays like May 25th. It can be enjoyed it all year-round, 
        but mostly in winter. This dish is prepared with meat, but if you want a veggie option, you can use, instead of meat, squash and 
        potatos. It's better to serve this dish in a clay or wooden casserole dish.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients (for 5 persons):</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>250 gr. white beans</li>
            <li>250 gr. cracked white corn</li>
            <li>400 gr. pork breast with skin</li>
            <li>1 red chorizo sausage</li>
            <li>200 gr. bacon</li>
            <li>300 gr. beef brisket</li>
            <li>2 spring onions</li>
            <li>3 onions</li>
            <li>1 squash</li>
            <li>1 leek</li>
            <li>1 bell pepper</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>A pinch of oregano</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps by step:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>It's important to let the corn and beans soak for 12 hours. After that time, chop the ingredients, including the meat and 
                vegetables. We'll also cut the chorizo into slices.</li>
            <li>Cook the pork rind in a pot for 10 minutes and let it rest.</li>
            <li>In a pot, place the bacon and add the diced green onion, leek, and onion.</li>
            <li>Now, add the chopped chorizo and the boiled pork rind. Then, add the corn and beans and stir with a wooden spoon.</li>
            <li>Add two cups of water and cover the pot. Let it cook for approximately 1 hour.</li>
            <li>After that time, add the pumpkin pieces and the meat. It's important to add a little more water until the ingredients are 
                covered.</li>
            <li>Season with salt, pepper, oregano, pepper, and paprika. Cover the pot and let it cook for an hour.</li>
            <li>Finally, you can accompany this dish with a delicious <em>quiquirimichi sauce</em>. To make it, fry the green onion. In another container 
                with water, add two tablespoons of paprika and ground chili. Add this mixture to the fried onion and let it cook for 5 
                minutes.</li>
        </ol>
