        <h1>Argentine Dulce de Leche</h1>
        <h2>Recipe made with milk, vanilla essence, baking soda and sugar</h2>
        <p>Dulce de leche is a delicious dessert commonly made in Argentina, where it undoubtedly holds an important place in traditional cuisine. 
        Its sweet flavor makes it a favorite among Argentinians and many foreigners. Although it is a delicious dessert, it is not recommended to 
        overeat it, as it can cause harmful health risks. We recommend stirring the dulce de leche with a wooden spoon; it's better and much easier to 
        prepare. Don't stir it too quickly to avoid accidents while preparing the dulce de leche. We also advise you to do it exactly as explained in this 
        recipe, to avoid any mistakes when preparing this delicacy.</p>
