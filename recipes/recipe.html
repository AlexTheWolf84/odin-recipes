                <h3>Step by step:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Place the rice and two liters of milk in a pot.</li>
                    <li>Cut a few pieces of lemon peel and add them to the pot.</li>
                    <li>Add a cinnamon stick to the rice pudding to flavor the mixture while cooking.</li>
                    <li>Let it sit for 30 to 60 minutes, allowing the rice to become fragrant and blend with the flavors of the cinnamon and lemon.</li>
                    <li>After the time has elapsed, place the pot on the stove and cover until it comes close to boiling.</li>
                    <li>When it's almost boiling, uncover the pot and stir the mixture gently.</li>
                    <li>When the rice is medium-cooked, add the sugar. Continue stirring until the milk begins to evaporate and the mixture thickens.</li>
                    <li>When it's cooked, turn off the heat, remove the cinnamon, and remove the lemon peel. Let the rice pudding rest while stirring 
                    until the milk evaporates.</li>
                    <li>Then, refrigerate for 20 minutes.</li>
                    <li>When you're ready to serve the rice pudding, add a little ground cinnamon.</li>
