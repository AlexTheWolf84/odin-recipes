        <h1>Argentine Beer Chicken</h1>
        <h2>A typical and traditional dish in Argentina.</h2>
        <p>This is a typical and traditional dish in Argentina. Both adults and children can enjoy it because the alcohol is released during 
            cooking. For this recipe, we use dark beer to give the dish a smooth, creamy finish. Don't let it cook for too long, as this will 
            cause the broth to run out.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients (for 4 persons):</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons oil</li>
            <li>1 chicken breast</li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Step by step:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>The first thing we'll do is take a saucepan and heat 1 tablespoon of oil and brown the chicken pieces on both sides.</li>
            <li>The next step is to saut√© the vegetables in the remaining oil until well cooked, then add the cornstarch and broth.</li>
            <li>Pour in the beer, water, and chicken pieces; cover and simmer for several minutes. When the chicken is tender, remove it 
                from the heat.</li>
