        <h1>Rice Pudding</h1>
        <h2>Rice pudding is a classic dessert that is now beloved throughout Latin America.</h2>
        <p>Rice pudding is one of the most popular traditional Argentine recipes in South America, where it has delighted both children and 
            adults. This is thanks to the fact that it is the quintessential dessert, not only for its flavor but also for how easy and affordable
            it is, making it affordable for all budgets. The rice should be round-grain because it absorbs liquids better, and before cooking, 
            you should wash the rice, but not too thoroughly. Instead of milk and sugar, you can use a mixture of condensed milk and cream, and you can also use 
            almond or soy milk. Always stir the mixture with a wooden spoon to prevent it from sticking to the pot.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>200 gr. of rice</li>
            <li>2 liters of milk</li>
            <li>300 gr. of sugar</li>
            <li>Cinnamon sticks and ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>Lemon peel</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps by step:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the rice and two liters of milk in a pot.</li>
            <li>Cut a few pieces of lemon peel and add them to the pot.</li>
            <li>Add a cinnamon stick to the rice pudding to flavor the mixture while cooking.</li>
            <li>Let it sit for 30 to 60 minutes, allowing the rice to become fragrant and blend with the flavors of the cinnamon and lemon.</li>
            <li>After the time has elapsed, place the pot on the stove and cover until it comes close to boiling.</li>
            <li>When it's almost boiling, uncover the pot and stir the mixture gently.</li>
            <li>When the rice is medium-cooked, add the sugar. Continue stirring until the milk begins to evaporate and the mixture thickens.</li>
            <li>When it's cooked, turn off the heat, remove the cinnamon, and remove the lemon peel. Let the rice pudding rest while stirring 
                until the milk evaporates.</li>
            <li>Then, refrigerate for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>When you're ready to serve the rice pudding, add a little ground cinnamon.</li>
        </ol>
